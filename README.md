============================================
Requirements:
-------------------
1. Boost Graph Library 1.55.0

   The Boost Graph Library is a header-only library and does not need to be
   built most of the time. But we do need a function that requires building
   `libboost_graph` and `libboost_regex`. To build the two libraries:

   1. Download the Boost library from here:

      `wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.55.0/boost_1_55_0.tar.gz`

   2. Unzip the tarball and set your `$BOOST_ROOT`:
      ```
      tar -xzvf boost_1_55_0.tar.gz
      cd boost_1_55_0
      export BOOST_ROOT=/your/path/to/boost_1_55_0/
      ```
   3. Run:

      `./bootstrap.sh`

   4. Install:

      ```
      mkdir build
      ./b2 --build-dir=./build --with-graph --with-regex
      ```

   5. It will compile these two libraries to `$BOOST_ROOT/stage/lib`

2. Recent version of GCC including some C++11 features (GCC 4.5+ should be ok).
   We use GCC 4.8.1.

3. LLVM 3.4.0 and Clang 3.4.0 64-bit

4. LLVM IR Trace Profiler (LLVM-Tracer)
   LLVM-Tracer is an LLVM compiler pass that instruments code in LLVM
   machine-independent IR. It prints out a dynamic trace of your program, which can
   then be taken as an input for Aladdin.

   You can find  LLVM-Tracer here:

   [https://github.com/ysshao/LLVM-Tracer.git]

   To build LLVM-Tracer:

   1. Set `LLVM_HOME` to where you installed LLVM

       ```
       export LLVM_HOME=/your/path/to/llvm
       export PATH=$LLVM_HOME/bin/:$PATH
       export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LLVM_HOME/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
      ```

   2. Go to where you put LLVM-Tracer source code

       ```
       cd /path/to/LLVM-Tracer
       cd /path/to/LLVM-Tracer/full-trace
       make
       cd /path/to/LLVM-Tracer/profile-func
       make
       ```

Build:
------
1. Set `$ALDDIN_HOME` to where put Aladdin source code.

   `export ALADDIN_HOME=/your/path/to/aladdin`

2. Set `$BOOST_ROOT` to where put Boost source code and update `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

   ```
   export BOOST_ROOT=/your/path/to/boost
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$BOOST_ROOT/stage/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   ```

3. Build aladdin

   ```
   cd $ALADDIN_HOME/common
   make -j4
   ```

Run:
----
After you build Aladdin and LLVM-Tracer, you can use example SHOC programs in the SHOC
directory to test Aladdin.

This distribution of Aladdin models fixed-function
accelerators with scratchpad memory. Parameters like loop unrolling factors for
each loop and memory partition (or memory bandwith) for each array allocated in
your program. The functional units power models are based on OpenPDK 45nm and SRAM model from
CACTI 5.3.

Example program: triad
----------------------
  We prepare a script to automatically run all the steps above: generating
  trace, config file and run Aladdin here:

  `$ALADDIN_HOME/SHOC/scripts/run_aladdin.py`

  You can run:

  ```
  cd $ALADDIN_HOME/SHOC/scripts
  python run_aladdin.py triad 2 2 1 6
  ```

  It will start Aladdin run at `$ALADDIN_HOME/SHOC/triad/sim/p2_u2_P1_6ns`

  The last three parameters are unrolling and partition factors and enabling
  loop pipelining in the config
  files. You can sweep these parameters easily with Aladdin.

Step-by-step:
----------------------
1. Go to `$ALADDIN_HOME/SHOC/triad`
2. Run LLVM-Tracer to generate a dynamic LLVM IR trace
   1. Both Aladdin and LLVM-Tracer track regions of interest inside a program. In the
      triad example, we want to analyze the triad kernel instead of the setup
      and initialization work done in main. To tell LLVM-Tracer the functions we are
      interested in, set enviroment variable `WORKLOAD` to be the function names):

    ```
    export WORKLOAD=triad
    ```
    (if you have multiple functions you are interested in, separate with commas):
    ```
    export WORKLOAD=md,md_kernel
    ```
   2. Generate LLVM IR:

    `clang -g -O1 -S -fno-slp-vectorize -fno-vectorize -fno-unroll-loops -fno-inline -emit-llvm -o triad.llvm triad.c`

   3. Run LLVM-Tracer pass:
      Before you run, make sure you already built LLVM-Tracer.
      Set `$TRACER_HOME` to where you put LLVM-Tracer code.

     ```
     export TRACER_HOME=/your/path/to/LLVM-Tracer
     opt -S -load=$TRACER_HOME/full-trace/full_trace.so -fulltrace triad.llvm -o triad-opt.llvm
     llvm-link -o full.llvm triad-opt.llvm $TRACER_HOME/profile-func/trace_logger.llvm
     ```

   4. Generate machine code:

     ```
     llc -filetype=asm -o full.s full.llvm
     gcc -fno-inline -o triad-instrumented full.s -lm -lz
     ```

   5. Run binary:

     `./triad-instrumented`

     It will generate a file called `dynamic_trace` under current directory.
     We provide a python script to run the above steps automatically for SHOC.

     ```
     cd $ALADDIN_HOME/SHOC/scripts/
     python llvm_compile.py $ALADDIN_HOME/SHOC/triad triad
     ```

3.config file

  Aladdin takes user defined parameters to model corresponding accelerator
  designs. We prepare an example of such config file at

  ```
  cd $ALADDIN_HOME/SHOC/triad/example
  cat config_example
  ```
  ```
  partition,cyclic,a,8192,4,2  //cyclic partition array a, size 8192B, wordsize is 4B, with partition factor 2
  partition,cyclic,b,8192,4,2  //cyclic partition array b, size 8192B, wordsize is 4B, with partition factor 2
  partition,cyclic,c,8192,4,2  //cyclic partition array c, size 8192B, wordsize is 4B, with partition factor 2
  unrolling,triad,5,2        //unroll loop in triad, define at line 5 in triad.c, with unrolling factor 2
  pipelining,1               //enable loop pipelining, applied to all loops
  cycle_time,6               //clock period, currently we support 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6ns.
  ```

  The format of config file is:

  ```
  partition,cyclic,array_name,array_size_in_bytes,wordsize,partition_factor
  unrolling,function_name,loop_increment_happened_at_line,unrolling_factor
  ```

  Two more configs:

  ```
  partition,complete,array_name,array_size_in_bytes //convert the array into register
  flatten,function_name,loop_increment_happend_at_line  //flatten the loop
  ```

  Note that you need to explicitly config how to partition each array in your
  source code. If you do not want to partition the array, declare it as
  partition_factor 1 in your config file, like:

  ```
  partition,cyclic,your-array,size-of-the-array,wordsize-of-each-element,1
  ```

4. Run Aladdin
   Aladdin takes three parameters:
   a. benchmark name
   b. path to the dynamic trace generated by LLVM-Tracer
   c. config file
   Now you are ready to run Aladdin by:

   ```
   cd $ALADDIN_HOME/SHOC/triad/example
   $ALADDIN_HOME/common/aladdin triad $ALADDIN_HOME/SHOC/triad/dynamic_trace config_example
   ```

   Aladdin will print out the different stages of optimizations and scheduling as
   it runs. In the end, Aladdin prints out the performance, power and area
   estimates for this design, which is also saved at <bench_name>_summary
   (triad_summary) in this case.

   Aladdin will generate some files during its execution. One file you might
   be interested is
    `<bench_name>_stats`
   which profiles the dynamic activities as accelerator is running. Its format:

   ```
   line1: cycles,<cycle count>,<# of nodes in the trace>
   line2: <cycle count>,<function-name-mul>,<function-name-add>,<each-partitioned-array>,....
   line3: <cycle 0>,<# of mul happend from functiona-name at cycle 0>,..
   line4: ...
   ```

    A corresponding dynamic power trace is
      `<bench_name>_stats_power`

5. Design Space
   We provide a simple script to show how to run Aladdin to generate the design
   space of a workload. The script is

  `$ALADDIN_HOME/SHOC/scripts/gen_space.py`

   You can run:

   ```
   cd $ALADDIN_HOME/SHOC/scripts
   python gen_space.py triad
   ```

   You can replace triad with any SHOC benchmark that we provide. It will
   automatically generate the config file and trigger Aladdin.

   It sweeps unrolling and partition factors, as well as turn on and off loop
   pipelining, to generate a power-performance-area design space. At the end of
   the script, if you have matplotlib installed, it will generate 6 plots of
   design spaces in terms of total-power vs cycles, fu-power vs cycles,
   mem-power vs cycles, total-area vs cycles, fu-area vs cycles, and mem-area vs
   cycles.

Caveats
-------
1. This distribution of Aladdin models the datapath and local scratcpad memory
of accelerators but not includes the rest of the memory hierarchy.
We are working on providing a release of Aladdin with a memory hierarchy. At the
same time, if you are interested in doing your customized integration, we will
provide a user`s guide on how to do the integration.

2. No Function Pipelining:

This distribution of Aladdin does not model function pipelining. In this
case, if a program has multiple functions built into accelerators, This
distribution of Aladdion assumes only function executes at a time.

3. Power Model Library:

This distribution of Aladdin characterizes power using OpenPDK 45nm
technology. The characterized power for functional units are in
`utils/power_delay.h`. If you are interested in trying different technologies,
modify the constants there with your power delay characteristics and then
recompile Aladdin. We will be releasing the microbenchmark set that we used to
do power characterization soon.
